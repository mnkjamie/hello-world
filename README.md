# hello-world
Trying to learn how to use git!
I went through a very intertwined journey to get here.
Since applying to Tisch ED in 2013, it has taken me 5 years to really find and commit to computer science.
I think it has partially taken me so long because I am simply not good at settling.
I guess that something from my past influenced me in a way that makes settling difficult for me.
But the time has come... I shall mark this as the point I put my two feet down on the ground.
I hope I'll be able to look back on this one day and have a little moment to myself.
No I know.
